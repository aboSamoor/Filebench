\paragraph{}
Currently Filebench initialize the files contents by assigning the files uninitialized memory segments.
 To control the entropy of the data written to the disk, we have to communicate more files data specific information to Filebench operations.

\paragraph{}
As the information we want to send to Filebench operations is data specific, it was ituitive to combine as this information as attributes to the structure that already keeps track of the files properities, \verb+fileset+.
Making the entropy as attribute of the filesets and not a global variable in the \verb+f+ scenario script gives us the flexibility to have filesets with different entropies.\\

\section{Filebench Interpreter}
The changes in the Filebench Interpreter have been designed to enable Filebench to optionally accept various datasources. These datasources are meant to be used to populate files created during benchmarking process. The Interpreter has thus been modified to accept new attributes called \verb+datasource+ and \verb+entropy+ as a part of the fileset command. For example a valid fileset command is:\\

\indent \verb+define fileset name=bigfileset,...,datasource=entro,entropy=3.4+
\paragraph{}
The attribute \verb+entropy+ is not directly an attribute of \verb+fileset+ command. It is a subattribute of the datasource type. For example the below is an invalid fileset definition.\\


\verb+define fileset name=bigfileset,path=\$dir,...,entropy=3.4+\\
\paragraph{}
All attributes for command \verb+fileset+ have a place in the \verb+struct fileset+. The \verb+datasouce+ attribute has also been placed in the structure. A new place has been created in this structure for \verb+datasource+ attribute alone and not for \verb+entropy+ attribute. The logic is that, the only attribute that makes sense to be part of \verb+fileset+ is the type of data defined by datasource. The attributes which define the data itself of the \verb+datasource+ are irrelevant to be part of \verb+fileset+ datastructure.
\paragraph{}
Since the a datasource can have various attributes of the data constituting it, \verb+datasource+ object has a pointer to a list of attribute objects relevant to it. This is the reason \verb+datasource+ is of type \verb+attr+ and not \verb+avd_t+. To accommodate  a list of sub-attributes inside an attribute(like the \verb+datasource+), \verb+struct attr+ has been modified.

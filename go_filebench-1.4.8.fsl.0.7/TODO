- fix compilation on SUN compilers (reported by Drew Schatt)

- fix multiple run invocations and part-by-part FileBench executione
(create-filset, create-proce, stat_snap, etc.) (reported by Drew Schatt)

- Testing system on calvin: VMs with different OSes.
- random file reading with seed, not /dev/urandom (Rick req.)
- fix multiple run invocations and part-by-part FileBench executione
(create-filset, create-proce, stat_snap, etc.) (Drew Schatt req.)
- Testing system: VMs with different OSes.
- On Solaris we get bzero() implicit declaration!
- On FreeBSD a lot of mutex attributes are not supported:
46604: 0.001: cannot set mutex attr PROCESS_SHARED on this platform on line 1
46604: 0.002: cannot set mutex attr PROCESS_SHARED on this platform on line 1
46604: 0.002: cannot set mutex attr PROCESS_SHARED on this platform on line 1
46604: 0.002: cannot set mutex attr PROCESS_SHARED on this platform on line 1
The main problem iS SHARED, that means if we have multiple
porcesses (not threads) we'll have issues. So, check it and fix if possible.
- usec/cpu-op is incorrect for oltp workload. OLTP in general works
    weird. Figure it out, do it only after process model is enabled.
- Check what happens if pthreads (and others, like lm) are not available
- Then do validation of thread vs process model (NFS Webproxy was different(?), e.g.)
- Look more carefully through Solaris-specific functions and data structures
- -D_REENTRANT, do we need it?
- FreeBSD, analog for /proc/stat or libkstat and /proc/<pid>/stat?
- leafdirs attributes for filesets does not work correctly: entry names
  for files collide with entry names for leafdirs.
- Ifdefs for all header files
- print all defines, sizeofs, functions used, or something like that
- reenable fscheck command later
- reenable multi_client_sync.c later
- Filebench does not support aio_read?
- HAVE_CFTIME -> HAVE_STRFTIME
- Auto-completio db is outdated
- Enforce configuration option:
	#ifdef HAVE_
		....
	#elif HAVE_
	#else
		ERROR
	#fi

	but not just if else that can easily fail.
- eemove config.h on make distclean
- modify filebench so that it supports reuse properly (even for writes)
  (then we can use dd of pre-stored  images - but how to store them?...)
- Sometimes on white we hang right after thread creation:
927: 7.180: Starting 100 filereaderthread threads
wchan shows: futex_wait_queue_meroot()
- add fb_ prefix to all function in order not to pollute namespace
- rename files properly
- Use __function__ constant.
- move random generation from posset.c to fb_random.c
- make a policy about abd_t usage.
